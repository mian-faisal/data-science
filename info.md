## What is Data?
Data is the collection of raw facts and figures, often in the form of numbers, text, or other formats, that serves as the basis for analysis and decision-making in various fields.\
e.g  (data_1.1)
| Index |  Name  | Age |  City   |     Subject     |
|-------|--------|-----|---------|-----------------|
|   0   | Faisal |  23 |  Lahore | Accountancy     |
|   1   | Ahsan  |  15 | Sahiwal | Data Sciences   |
|   2   |   Ali  |  50 | Karachi | Data Sciences   |

## What is information?
Information is data that has been transformed into a meaningful context, offering insights or understanding. It is the result of data processing and interpretation.\
**e.g.** the given data informs 66% of the participants study data sciences

## What is Science?
Science is a systematic and methodical process of acquiring, organizing, and applying knowledge through observation, experimentation, and the formulation of testable hypotheses to understand and explain natural phenomena and the world around us.\
**e.g** Physics, Chemistry, Biology

## What is Data Science?
Data Science is a combination of two words Data & Science explained below. Data science is a multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, algorithms, processes, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data.


## Types of Data
### Structured Data:
Structured data is highly organized and typically exists in a **tabular format** with a clear schema. It is easy to search, store, and analyze.\
**e.g** The given data is structured data\
   databases, spreadsheets, CSV(coma separated values) ,TSV(tab separated values) ,data frame
### Unstructured Data:
Unstructured data lacks a specific structure or format. It is more free-form and can take various shapes, such as text documents, images, audio, video, social media posts, emails, and sensor data.\
e.g. comments, customer reviews, and images.

> Unstructured data lacks a specific structure or format. It is more free-form and can take various shapes.\
> e.g. XML(Extensible Markup Language), JSON(JavaScript Object Notation), and HTML(Hypertext Markup Language).

## Catagories of Data
### Qualitative
- nominal
- ordinal
> Qualitative data is also called Categorical Data
### Quantitative
- continuous
  - intervals
  - ratios
- discrete
> Quantitative data is also called Numerical Data

### Data-Frame
A data frame is a fundamental data structure used in data analysis and manipulation in programming languages and libraries like R, Python (with libraries like Pandas), and Julia.
> A structure created by the combination of rows and columns using some programming languages is called a data frame.

> Other names of Dataframe
> - dataset
> - table

## Components of a Data Frame

### columns
a column refers to a vertical line of cells in a data frame.\
**e.g** in the given data first column is defined as:
|  Name  |
|--------|
| Faisal |
| Ahsan  |
|   Ali  |
> **Other Names of columns used by programmers**
> - attributes
> - features  
> - dimensions
> - variables
> - fields
> - properties

### Rows
a row refers to a horizontal line of cells.\
**e.g** in the given data first row is defined as:
|   0   | Faisal |  23 |  Lahore | Accountancy     |
> **Other Names of rows used by programmers**
> - records
> - entries
> - values
> - intense

###  Data Head
the row consists of headings that represent columns in the table is called data head.
**e.g** in the given data head is defined as:
| Index | Name | Age | City | Subject |
|-------|------|-----|------|---------|



###  Data Index
the column that represents the number of each row in a sequence in a table is called index.
**e.g** in the given data index is defined as:
| Index |
|-------|
|   0   |
|   1   |
|   2   |
> In Python, the Index starts from 0. So, the indexing is as 0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd & so on.

###  Data Point
Data Points: These are individual pieces of data or records in the dataset. Each data point contains values or measurements for one or more variables.
**e.g** in the given data index is defined as:
| Faisal|
|-------|

|   1   |
|-------|
> **Other Names of data points used by programmers**
> - observation
> - cell

### Data Format
Datasets can be stored in various formats depending on ease and requirement.
**e.g**  Table of some most famous formats are as follows:
| Index |             Name            |    Data Types   |     Subject   |
|-------|-----------------------------|-----------------|---------------|
|   0   |        Excel/sheets         |   Structured    |               |
|   1   | CSV(coma separated values)  |   Structured    |    1,2,3      |
|   2   |  TSV(Tab-separated values)  |   Structured    |    1  2  3    |
|   3   |      Database(SQL/NoSQL)    |       Both      |               |
|   4   |            JSON             |    Structured   |               |
|   5   |            HDF              |  UnStructured   |               |
|   6   |          Parquet            |  UnStructured   |    1  2  3    |

## Steps involved in Data Sciences 
### 1- Pre-Requests
- Identify the Problem need solution\
  e.g increase sales, create a model, forecasting
- Create a Flowchart of solution\
  **e.g**
### 2- Data Collection
- Wh Questions(what, when, where, who, whom, which, whose, why and how)\
  We make all relevant questions and identify our target population\
  **e.g** Here are some mandatory questions\
  What type of Data?  Primary/Secondary\
  How to collect data data census(population)/survey()\
  Which type of data structured/unstructured
### 3- Pre-process
Eda
- descriptive(what happened)
- diagnostic(why happened)
### 4- Data Analysis
- Statistics
  - inferential
- ML
- DL
### 5- Visualize
-  Create Graphs & Chart
-  Prepare Reports
-  Create Story & Presentation
### 6- Final Step
- prediction(what will happen)
- data-driven decision making
- prescriptive(what to do)
- Destroy
-
