## What is Data Science?
Data Science is a combination of two words Data & Science explained below. Data science is a multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, algorithms, processes, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data.

## What is Science?
Science is a systematic and methodical process of acquiring, organizing, and applying knowledge through observation, experimentation, and the formulation of testable hypotheses to understand and explain natural phenomena and the world around us.\
e.g Physics, Chemistry, Biology
  
## What is Data?
Data is the collection of raw facts and figures, often in the form of numbers, text, or other formats, that serves as the basis for analysis and decision-making in various fields.\
e.g  (data_1.1)
|  Name  | Age |  City   |     Subject     |
|--------|-----|---------|-----------------|
| Faisal |  23 |  Lahore | Accountancy     |
| Ahsan  |  15 | Sahiwal | Data Sciences   |
|   Ali  |  50 | Karachi | Data Sciences   |

## What is information?
Information is data that has been transformed into a meaningful context, offering insights or understanding. It is the result of data processing and interpretation.\
e.g. the given data informs 66% of the participants study data sciences

## Types of Data
### Structured Data:
Structured data is highly organized and typically exists in a **tabular format** with a clear schema. It is easy to search, store, and analyze.\
e.g The given data is structured data
   databases, spreadsheets, CSV(coma separated values) ,TSV(tab separated values) 
### Unstructured Data:
Unstructured data lacks a specific structure or format. It is more free-form and can take various shapes, such as text documents, images, audio, video, social media posts, emails, and sensor data.\
e.g. comments, customer reviews, and images.

> e.g. XML(Extensible Markup Language), JSON(JavaScript Object Notation), and HTML(Hypertext Markup Language).
